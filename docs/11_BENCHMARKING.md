# Benchmarking Plan

## 1. Rule

A performance claim without a reproducible benchmark is not accepted.

## 2. Record environment

Every benchmark report stores:

- CPU model;
- RAM;
- GPU model(s);
- VRAM;
- driver version;
- accelerator/runtime version;
- OS/kernel;
- Rust version;
- Burn version;
- git commit;
- backend;
- dtype;
- model config;
- batch size;
- sequence length;
- warmup count;
- measurement count.

## 3. Training metrics

Report:

- tokens/sec;
- sequences/sec;
- step latency p50/p95 when relevant;
- peak memory;
- data-loader wait time if measurable;
- host→device transfer time if measurable;
- utilization if available;
- checkpoint write/read throughput.

## 4. Inference metrics

Separate:

### Prefill

- prompt tokens/sec;
- time-to-first-token.

### Decode

- generated tokens/sec;
- inter-token latency.

### Server

- request throughput;
- p50/p95/p99 latency;
- queue time;
- cancellation behavior;
- memory under concurrency.

## 5. Benchmark shapes

At minimum Stage 1:

- batch 1, seq 128;
- batch 1, seq 512;
- batch 1, seq 2048;
- representative training micro-batch at seq 2048;
- generation prompt 128 + 128 new tokens;
- generation prompt 1024 + 128 new tokens.

## 6. Comparison discipline

When comparing implementations:

- same weights;
- same dtype where possible;
- same hardware;
- same batch/sequence;
- warmed execution;
- exclude one-time compile/JIT cost unless measuring cold start;
- report cold start separately.

## 7. Cold-start benchmark

For serverless/embedded goals report:

```text
process start
→ runtime/device init
→ model load
→ first successful inference
```

Record binary size and model artifact size separately.

## 8. Optimization acceptance

An optimization stays only if:

- correctness tests pass;
- it improves the intended metric on target hardware;
- it does not cause unacceptable regression elsewhere;
- complexity is justified by the measured gain.

## 9. Regression thresholds

After obtaining the first stable baseline, CI benchmark thresholds may be introduced. Do not invent thresholds before baseline variance is measured.
